# Arknoid_Game
This is a personal project that I've been working on in OOP course in Computer Science at Bar-Ilan university.
This is an Arkanoid game written in Java and was designed with multiple OOP principles and behavioral design patterns.

Mainly used design patterns:
- Template Method
- Observable
- Facade
