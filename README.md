# Arkanoid_Game
This is a personal project that I've been working on in OOP course in Computer Science at Bar-Ilan university.
This is an Arkanoid game written in Java and was designed with multiple OOP principles and design patterns.

Mainly used design patterns in the project:
- Template Method
- Observable
- Facade

------------------------
Note:
Make sure that you download the attached jar file and that it's placed in the same directory as src file.
